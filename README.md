# PyDPValidator 

This repo adapts code from https://github.com/xiyangl3/adp-estimator/ to apply the techniques in that repo's [accompanying paper, Minimax Optimal Estimation of Approximate Differential Privacy on Neighboring Databases] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10335) to examining [PyDP] (https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP).
## Dependencies

* To run the experiments, you need to have the following libraries installed:
    
1. python = 3.6
2. numpy
3. scipy

* The coefficient of best polynomial approximation are pre-computed and stored as ".mat" file. The coefficient of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are stored as ".npy" file. 

* To get the coefficient of best polynomial approximation, you need to install Chebfun in Matlab through http://www.chebfun.org/

* To get the coefficient of Chebyshev polynomials, you need to install:

1. sympy
